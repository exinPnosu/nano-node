Space Scavenger is the result of five years of hobby game development by two friends from Sweden, Jonas and Jacob. They started working on the game in 2016 as a side project, inspired by games like FTL, Spore, and Kerbal Space Program. They wanted to create a game that combined their love for space exploration, spaceship building, and roguelike gameplay. They also wanted to make a game that was easy to pick up and play, but hard to master.
 
They developed the game using Unity and C#, and used Blender for 3D modeling and Photoshop for 2D art. They also used tools like Audacity for sound editing and Bfxr for sound effects. They did most of the work on their spare time, while balancing their day jobs and personal lives. They faced many challenges and setbacks along the way, such as technical issues, design changes, feedback loops, and scope creep. They also had to learn a lot of new skills and technologies, such as procedural generation, online multiplayer, and Nintendo Switch porting.
 
Despite the difficulties, they never gave up on their vision and passion for the game. They launched the game on Steam Early Access in June 2020, and received positive feedback and support from the community. They continued to update and improve the game based on player suggestions and bug reports. They also participated in various events and showcases, such as Steam Game Festival, Indie Arena Booth, DreamHack Winter, and Indie World Order. They are now preparing to release the game on Nintendo Switch and PC 1.0 later this summer.
