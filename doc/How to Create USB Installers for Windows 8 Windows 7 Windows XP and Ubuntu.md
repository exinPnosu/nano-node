If you want to install a new operating system on your PC, you might need a USB installer. A USB installer is a flash drive that contains the installation files for a specific OS. You can use a USB installer to boot your PC and start the installation process without using a DVD or CD.

Creating a USB installer is not difficult, but you need to have a few things ready before you begin:
  
- A PC with a reliable internet connection.
- A USB flash drive or external hard drive with at least 8 GB of space.
- An ISO file of the OS you want to install. An ISO file is a disc image that contains all the data of a CD or DVD. You can download ISO files from the official websites of the OS developers, such as Microsoft or Ubuntu.
- A product key for the OS you want to install (not required for Ubuntu).
- A tool that can create bootable USB drives from ISO files. There are many tools available online, but we will use Rufus[^3^] as an example in this article.

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps to create your USB installer:

1. Plug your USB flash drive or external hard drive into your PC.
2. Download Rufus from its official website[^3^] and run it. Rufus is a portable tool that does not require installation.
3. Select your USB drive from the "Device" dropdown menu.
4. Select "MBR" from the "Partition scheme" dropdown menu.
5. Select "NTFS" from the "File system" dropdown menu.
6. Select "Default" from the "Cluster size" dropdown menu.
7. Check the "Create a bootable disk using" option and click on the small CD icon next to it. Browse to the location of your ISO file and select it.
8. Click on "Start" and wait for Rufus to create your USB installer. This may take several minutes depending on the size of your ISO file and the speed of your USB drive.
9. When Rufus is done, you can close it and safely eject your USB drive.

You have now created a USB installer for your desired OS. To use it, you need to plug it into the PC where you want to install the OS and change the boot order in the BIOS settings to boot from the USB drive first. Then, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
  
Note: The steps above are for creating USB installers for Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows XP and Ubuntu. If you want to create USB installers for other OSes, you may need to use different tools or settings. Please refer to the official documentation of the OS you want to install for more details.
  
## Benefits of USB Installers
  
Using USB installers for your OS has several advantages over using traditional DVD or CD installers. Here are some of them:

- USB installers are faster and more reliable than DVD or CD installers. USB drives have higher data transfer rates and lower seek times than optical discs, which means they can load the installation files more quickly and smoothly. USB drives are also less prone to scratches, dust, or damage that can affect the readability of optical discs.
- USB installers are more portable and convenient than DVD or CD installers. You can easily carry a USB drive in your pocket or bag and use it on any PC that supports USB booting. You don't need to worry about finding a DVD or CD drive or carrying multiple discs for different OSes. You can also reuse your USB drive for other purposes after installing the OS.
- USB installers are more versatile and flexible than DVD or CD installers. You can create multiple partitions on your USB drive and install different OSes on each partition, creating a multi-boot USB installer. You can also create a live USB installer that allows you to run the OS directly from the USB drive without installing it on the PC. This can be useful for testing, troubleshooting, or recovering your PC.

As you can see, USB installers offer many benefits over DVD or CD installers. However, they also have some drawbacks, such as higher cost, lower capacity, and shorter lifespan than optical discs. Therefore, you should weigh the pros and cons of each option before choosing the best one for your needs.
